You'll receive a link accompanied by a six-digit pin from the owner of the Jam Sesh. This is how your browser is given its `sessionToken`, your only form of authentication since there are no user accounts. [Read more about anonymous sessions here](anonymous-sessions.md).

You'll provide a display name for this Jam Sesh, which will accompany your contributions so other users can attribute a _fantastic_ contribution to the right user!

After you have your display name, you're ready to contribute. You can contribute one of two ways.
