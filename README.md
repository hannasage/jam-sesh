# Spread

The advent of streaming services for music brought about a new inhibitor in the art consumer experience. Growing up, there was never any question of if your `.mp3` would play on someone elses mp3 player or not. Apple _did_ have a protected format specific to iTunes and the iPod, but like, duh. It's Apple. 🖕🏻 Anyway, what if you could just share music without having to remember who uses what service for music consumption? That'd be great, right?

Enter: Spread. The idea stems from our community channel at Fearless, `#club-spread-your-jams`, where we share music. In the channel, unfortunately, there's a wide variety of unique services with links _only_ to their unique service, so often, jams can fall through the crumb of the bread, right on to the plate, and never be consumed. To increase our bread's density and prevent jam fall-through, the idea is to provide a service that will take in an artist and song name, and produce links for all major music services.
